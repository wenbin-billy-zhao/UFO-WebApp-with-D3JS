## Background Information (!! Classified !!)

This is an important exercise to load JSON like data set to html page and use D3.js and Javascript to sort and filter data based on user input (such as date, location, etc.)

## Milestone 1 - Auto Table and Data Search 
- my process involved from using D3 to extract array keys from data set - filter throgh and return unique values - sort values, map them to a new array (Date, City, State, Country)

## Milestone 2 - Build d3.js / javascript drop down list of unique values of filtered data
- drop down list combo box built with html dynamically

## Milestone 3 - Build filtered resuilt data table based on drop down selection
- filter result of result table and dynamically generate filtered data

## Milestone 4 - Build bootstrap 4 responsive table layout with sorting, pagnation, and search, in memory processing
- using Bootstrap 4 CSS / JS and customized CSS to generate responsive data table with several advanced functions
- pagnation
- serach box
- real-time sorting

## Milestone 5 - the fun part - CSS styling - make my own html homepage rather than the standard template
- add jumbotron (bootstrap4) to top banner, with embeded background image
- custom Google Fonts
- fun stuff
